# Multi-Scale Spiking Network Model of Human Cerebral Cortex

This code implements the multi-scale spiking network model known as the Human Multi-Area Model (**HuMAM**) developed at 
the Institute for Advanced Simulation (IAS-6), Forschungszentrum Jülich. The model has been documented in the following 
publication:

**Model overview**: The model comprises all 34 areas of the Desikan-Killiany parcellation in one hemisphere of human 
cerebral cortex. Each area is modeled by a column with 1 $mm^{2}$ cortical surface. Within each column, the full number 
of neurons and synapses based on anatomical data is included. In total, this leads to 3.47 million neurons and 42.8 
billion synapses. Both the intrinsic and the cortico-cortical connectivity are layer- and population-specific.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites
### Data

Data extracted from experimental references and necessary to run the codes can be found in 
[experimental_data/](./experimental_data/) folder. These files will be automatically loaded when running the simulation 
(check section [How to run](#how-to-run) for details).

Please note that some data has to be manually downloaded. Specifically, the data stored in 
`./experimental_data/macaque/` and `./experimental_data/rutishauser/`. Both data are only required for specific plots, 
not being necessary to run the examples presented here.

### Requirements

The entire workflow of the model, from data preprocessing through the simulation to the final analysis, relies on the 
`Python` programming language. The complete list of Python packages with the specific version we used to run our 
simulations can be found in ```humam.yml``` file. Other package versions may not work properly.

Note: All network simulations in [Pronold et al. (2024)](#1) were performed using the `NEST simulator` version `2.20.2` 
(https://www.nest-simulator.org/). To run this version, please check the code released for HuMAM versions below 2.0.0.

## Installation

### Python modules using Mamba
The Python modules can be installed with the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)
 data science platform (similar to `conda` but faster) or via its free minimal installer called 
 [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html). 

#### On a local machine
All dependencies are handled using ```mamba```. 

On a local computer, simply run:
```
mamba env create -f humam.yml
```  
This command will create an environment and automatically install all Python packages defined in the ```humam.yml``` 
file. 

Once installed, you can activate your environment with:
```
mamba activate humam
```

From this step, you are already ready to test the model by running the downscaled example in `humam_tutorial.ipynb`.

#### On a cluster

On a cluster, ```snakemake``` can automatically create the mamba/conda environment for you if you add the `--use-conda` 
option to `snakemake_slurm.sh`. For this, first, remove the `- nest-simulator` dependency from ```humam.yml```. Once 
```NEST simulator``` is not included in this file, you can install NEST via the instructions below.

Depending on your cluster configuration, it can be better to use the modules already installed in the system rather than
 installing the packages via mamba/conda. More details in ["How to run"](#how-to-run) section.  

### NEST installation

All different methods to install NEST can be found in their extensive documentation: 
https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/index.html. 

**If using HuMAM below v2.0.0**: In our published results, we used the "Install NEST from source" option with NEST 
```2.20.2``` version. Note: after the step to clone nest-simulator from GitHub, change the branch with: 
```git checkout v2.20.2```. <br>
**Current version**: The latest version of our code (Release version of HuMAM from 2.0.0 onwards) was tested using NEST 
```3.8```.

The NEST installation path will have to be specified in `config.yaml` described in the ["How to run"](#how-to-run) 
section.

## How to run

The example below shows how to prepare the configuration files and how to run the code. 
**Note**: For a simplified version of the workflow and to test the code on a local machine, you can follow the 
instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section and skip the next instructions.

All the workflow is managed using the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) tool. To run different 
network setups or experiments, the user has only to set the parameters in a Python script (two examples are shown in 
[./experiments/](./experiments/)) and simulate following the instructions below.

### Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file inside the repository's main directory. An example is shown in `config_jureca.yaml`. Please 
note that the NEST path should be given as: `<path_to_NEST_installation>/install/`. 
If running in a cluster, you must also define the cluster configurations on the `cluster.json` file. An example is also 
given, but you should modify it accordingly with your cluster configuration.

### Run on a cluster

To run the model on a cluster, ensure you have a working `snakemake` installation and type: 

```
bash snakemake_slurm.sh
```

**NOTE**: to run the current version on JURECA cluster (Jülich Supercomputing Centre at Forschungszentrum Jülich), it is
 recommended to use the modules defined in `config_jureca.yaml` file instead of the mamba/conda environment. If so, make
  sure the `--use-conda` flag is not in the `snakemake_slurm.sh` script before running the code line above.

This script will run the workflow defined in `Snakefile`, which follows the sequence:
1. read all `*.py` experiment files contained in the `./experiments/` directory. **NOTE**: If you want to run fewer/more
 experiments, remove/add these files from the `./experiments/` directory.
2. load necessary modules for MPI and NEST before executing
3. create the network
4. simulate the network
5. analyse the results from simulation

By default, the resulting simulation data will be stored in the `./out` directory. For each experiment, different 
information regarding network, simulation, and analysis details will be stored following this structure:

`./out/<network_hash>/<simulation_hash>/<analysis_hash>`

The hash identifiers are automatically generated based on the set of parameters defined on the network, simulation, and 
analysis dictionaries.

### Ploting figures

After running the complete workflow described in ["Run on a cluster"](###run-on-a-cluster) section, you can find the 
raster plots and other figures automatically generated from the simulation results in

`./out/<network_hash>/<simulation_hash>/<analysis_hash>/plots/` 

Other figures shown in [1] can be manually plotted using the scripts in `./misc/publication_figures/` named as 
"figure_*". These figures are stored at `./figures/`. For instance, after running the ground and best-fit state 
experiments, from the main directory you can plot figures 4 and 6 presented in [1] by running the script:

```
python ./misc/publication_figures/figure_spike_statistics.py
```
